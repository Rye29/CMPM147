                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Minecraft caves is a tribute to one of the older, yet most influential examples<br>
						of proc gen: minecraft. This is meant to represent the old, yet gold generation<br>
						of caves in minecraft. Back when I was a kid, minecraft, even before infinite worlds,<br>
						was the primary leader in procedurally generated worlds, creating nearly infinite <br>
						adventures for us as kids.<br>
						<br>
						Part of this piece's appeal is nostalgia as well as paying respects to what paved the<br>
						way for all proc gen users out there: minecraft walked so we could run. Caves used to<br>
						be one of the best places to go exploring because it was the one biome that actively<br>
						forced you to leave your mark inside it by mining out walls to find coal and ore.<br>
						That's exactly what this generator allows you to do: live out the old days of<br>
						carving your own path in the untapped underground.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The base of this generator is based on a perlin noise map, however, I coded a fake erosion <br>
					algorithm when ran on each tile checks to see how many blocks next to it are similar to itself. <br>
					If itâ€™s not similar enough, it inverts the block type (wall/floor). I took the sum of two of <br>
					these erosion layers and it filled any airpockets that stood out too much as well as created larger,<br>
				    more interesting cave rooms. I used hash values, color caching, and multiplication to dynamically <br>
					color the stone parts of the cave, then I added dirt patches with another comparison of hash values, <br>
					just like how minecraft scatters dirt throughout its caves sometimes. </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The final generator of this experiment was the easiest to implement, as the other two provided much challenge through<br>
				   finding the right algorithms, tweaking algorithms and adjusting gradients. At this point, I had kind of already gotten<br> 
				   a good grip on how to use the rendering engine. However, while uncomplicated by comparison, this generator has a lot of beauty <br>
				   in its simplicity and its winding compartments.</p>
