# Brian Hudick Generative Design, Spring 2025
Class was used as a medium to experiment with different procedural design methods

In general, we used an "imitate, integrate, and innovate" design process to understand and extend new code: the idea was to extend the projects to as far as they could be used computationally in order to provide interesting results. Using the p5.js web engine, the actual backbone of each project was heavily simplified in order to focus more on the generative methods the class was trying to teach.
