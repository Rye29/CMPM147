                    <p>An 'infinite world' is meant to create a nearly limitless experience to give a user a <br>
						technically new experience everytime they dive in. For this experience, I replicated <br>
						Minecraft's snowy mountain biome because most of the time when I think about <br>
						wandering, it's almost always in a snowy plane, climbing slopes to explore a cold, yet <br>
						curious land. In respect to my source material, you can leave your mark physically by <br>
						digging out the ground to access underground water, making your mark on the land. <br></p>
                </div>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> The moutainous terrain was created with a perlin noise map which was created by <br>
					being fed a world seed. It is then fed through a finite distance algorithm which <br>
					determines how high and how low each part of the map should look. I then created <br>
					fake 3d using a 3/4th view in order to fake a 'z axis' (up/down in 3d space), using the <br>
					combination of the x and y planes, side to side on the screen and up and down in 2d <br>
					space. This fake up and down reflects the changes in physical altitude alongside a <br>
					gradient that colors the the terrain based on the illusioned altitude. Finally, using the <br>
					hash value of each world coordinate, I used an algorithm to populate the highest parts <br>
					of the terrain with trees and cabins, both of which are sprites created by yours truly.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This one was much easier since I'd completed it earlier when I designed the course.</p>
