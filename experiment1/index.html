				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>My intention was to build a simple auto generator that emulated the same programs used by spam ad bots. <br>
					I always thought those things were annoying, so I decided to build the thing I hate, just to prove that <br>
					anyone could make these things. I recently received a lot of automated rejection emails so that kind of <br>
					fueled my remixed creation. I felt that I had to include a few obvious jokes in there so that it didn't <br>
					get too cynical. I think everyone who gets annoyed at spam emails would get at least a nasal exhale out <br>
					of my take on the text generator.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>One problem I ran into was the action kept changing so I had to cache the generation in a constant order to <br>
				   keep it consistent. After all, it's meant to emulate a spam email, and at the very least, the hobby needs to <br>
				   be consistent. Working in HTML was a little slow when just pushing and publishing to a remote server, so I <br>
				   installed the Live Preview extension to help speed things up.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>	Majority of the backbone of this project was all Professor Wes Modes in the technical part of the generator since <br>
					they provided the template. I worked on this experiment on my own besides the Professor providing the base resources <br>
					since I believed that it was important that I be able to support myself in a project setting before supporting others. <br>
					I have worked with glitch in high school and this was a great refresher as well as a good way to learn how to transfer <br>
					my work into a proper portfolio.<br>
					<br>
					Documentation is a little annoying, but I understand the importance of it. It shows what the developers were trying to <br>
					do and what they were thinking. It’s also giving me a good retrospective view on how I could improve my workflow, for <br>
					example I could’ve sat down and planned out when to do this assignment better because I kind of sat down for two hours, <br>
					did the glitch project and initial transfer in one session and now I’m writing the reflection after debugging in the <br>
					second. Other than that, I feel like I did a decent job on this intro experiment.
