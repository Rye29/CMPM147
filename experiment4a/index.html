                    <p>While infinity is mathematically impossible in computers, we can get practically close to it.<br>
						An ocean is infinite to a fish in a small pond, which is exactly what I wanted the user to feel<br>
						with wave horizons.<br>
						<br>
						The connection between exploration and the ocean, and seemingly limitless discovery<br>
						is encapsulated in the seabased exploration inspired by games like Sea of Thieves<br>
						where you could almost always find a new adventure waiting for you.<br>
						<br>
						The project demonstrates how even in a simplified format, even the older math techniques<br>
						combined with a bit of curiosity for the unknown shows how something new<br>
						is always waiting out there for you.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The 3D artstyle was created by using isometric drawing techniques using p5js polygon<br>
					draw functions, as well as a variety if gradient color techniques to help give the<br>
					illusion of 3D. The waves use Trochoidal wave theory to emulate ocean swells.<br>
					Finally, two perlin noise gradients combined with two sine waves are used to create<br>
					the island clusters as well as ensuring there's minimum distance between each cluster.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was the first of three generators I built for this experiment. And it's the one I'm most proud of<br>
				   I had a lot of trouble getting the parameters correct just because of scaling, it was incredibly satisfying<br>
				   getting it exactly how I wanted it to. I had to actually disable fullscreen just because it broke the illusion.<br>
			       It lags a bit but that's expected with how computationally intensive it was to render it all.</p>
