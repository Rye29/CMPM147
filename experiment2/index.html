				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project offers a generative, living impression of this inspiring image:</p>
				<a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/poster/Boho-Mountain-Range-Blue-by-digieverything/145556392.LVTDI?country_code=US&epik=dj0yJnU9cHlrWlBBV3lfU20yTXNMS1lPb2lweEZfaGlJa0xRM1MmcD0wJm49c1h1NzgybmRYaVZQVmNZWkFoWmp5ZyZ0PUFBQUFBR2Y1bFI4">
				<img src="../img/inspiring.png" alt="click to go to original page"></img>
				</a>
				<p>Color: The pallete was all sampled from my reference image above.<br>
					I decided that the pallete felt like it was inspiring a dawn of<br>
					a new day, so I tried to stick to it as best I could.<br>
				
					Primitives: The sun and the fog are both rendered using simple ellipses, as there<br>
					wasn't too much variation needed to make them both look good.<br>
					<br>
					Polygons: The mountains and the sky are both generated with sine and cosine curves,<br>
					using math to add variation.<br>
					<br>
					Composition: Different random seed values create noticeably different mountain ranges<br>
					as well as interesting looking skylines.<br>
					<br>
					Life: The skylines have slight variations that change overtime to simulate the movement<br>
					of air and moisture to demonstrate how reflection of light changes with moving moisture.<br>
					Another life feature is the parallax effect where the position of everything shifts with the<br>
					<br>
					mouse position: the closer an object would be to the viewer in a 3d space, the more it'd move<br>
					from the viewer's perspective (sun doesn't move at all, foreground moves the most). The interactive drawing<br>
					itself is meant to make you feel like you're seeing the sun at dawn on the precipice of a mountain.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The skyline shapes utilize a Sine function to establish a “control” shape and a cosine function to add more variation <br>
				   in shape over the course of the picture’s lifetime. The Parallax effect was created using the mouse location multiplied<br>
				   by a "distance" factor which was then subtracted from each shape's position in the canvas. The mountain range was created <br>
				   using another sine curve that peaks at either end of the canvas, and then used the random() function to add some nice variation. <br>
				   The abs() function was made to control just how much each vertex was allowed to change from the curve, with the center vertices <br>
				   having little to no change and the edges of the canvas being allowed to change the most. The highlights were created using the <br>
				   stroke() feature of the p5js graphics library.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>	     The one thing that I genuinely struggled with at first was trying to get the sine curves to work when graphing <br>
					out the vertices for the skyline. I have to thank a couple of my game dev friends, who happen to be alumni of UCSC, <br>
					for helping me graph out how I wanted each base curve to look like on desmos, an online graphing calculator. After <br>
					the skylines, however, I felt that I went absolutely ham on the PCG features. I felt really crafty for pulling the <br>
					absolute function from my memory in order to properly implement the mountain generation.<br>
					<br>
					    Even though the parallax effect was present in the example code, to some degree, provided to us by Professor Modes, <br>
					I feel very proud of myself for improving it by adding a second dimension to it as well as building on top of the existing <br>
					x-axis parallax. I really love 3D rendering so I tried my best to sell the illusion of standing in a 3D space the best I could, <br>
					and I feel like it really paid off in the final product, while still maintaining p5’s 2D charm. The only thing I would’ve added,<br>
					had time let me, would be to make the stroke weight of the highlights more dynamic with the outline of the mountain vertices’ <br>
					heights. Overall, I’d say that the effort I put in was maximal.
