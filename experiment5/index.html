				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I am trying to create a generator that reads an image <br>
                   and tries to match the overall composition of it using primitive shapes and <br>
                   colors. I used ellipses and rectangles because at the end of the day, you can <br>
                   adapt any shape using sharp lines and arcs. The theme of this experiment, in my eyes,<br>
                   is beauty in organized chaos as well as a testament to human pattern recognition.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The genereator creates primitives in a grid fashion then averages the colors <br>
                   of all the pixels in the area it covers. Once that's done, it adds a slight bit <br>
                   of error to the coordinates of the shape before pushing it to an object container.<br>
                   Finally, it mutates the design by randomizing the coordinates and dimensions of each<br>
                   primitive within a boundary through a gaussian blur function. The higher the slider factor<br>
                   the more drastic the mutations are. Finally, the images are evaluated and given a similarity<br>
                   score and are then recorded. Best results are achieved when mutations start big and gradually<br>
                   decrease.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Actually building this thing was a lot more difficult than I anticipated, primarily because <br>
                    the example project on Professor Wes Modes portfolio was all based around black and white images.<br>
                    I wanted to integrate color into mine to stand out which made the process a lot harder than it probably<br>
                    should have been. Luckily thanks to Raven Cruz and Jackie Sanchez posting their solution to that <br>
                    problem on the discord, I was able to debug my own and put my own spin on it by taking every pixel,<br>
                    averaging out the color and using it as a fill background for each mutation.<br>
                    <br>
                    I thought that experimenting with the images and p5jsâ€™ loadpixel() index was a lot more fun than I<br>
                    anticipated. Even though it was a struggle at first, it made me realize that I enjoy overcoming <br>
                    challenges that are hard under the hood but simple on the surface. But I think the part that really<br> 
                    shined during this experiment was actually getting to play around with the final product being part<br>
                    of the requirements. At the end of the day, I felt this experiment was a pretty good one.</p>
