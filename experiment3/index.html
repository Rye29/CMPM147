				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Using autotiler logic, procedural noise, and p5js, I created a dungeon room<br>
				   generator and a desert map generator that procedurally builds using the autotiler<br>
				   and a generated seed. The dungeon was inspired by Legend of Zelda and Castlevania<br>
				   while the primary inspiration of the desert was Dune (2021)</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>For both generators, I used p5's noise() function to generate the overlay effects and <br>
				   a mix of sin(), seconds() and millis() to move them across the screen. The Dungeon generator<br>
				   works by connecting abstract cubes together to create a unique room shape. The desert generator<br>
				   uses perlin noise to generate a representation of a topological map with the rounded up peaks being<br>
				   represented by mountains and darker sand representing the deepest points</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I’ll cut straight to the point: I think this is more of a solid A than A plus work from me. While I<br>did fulfill the assignment requirements and then some, I feel like I did that extra work for that<br>extra point because I felt like my work wasn’t good enough. Although it is a generator and it’s<br>not going to be perfect, I think that I just have trouble accepting that as a 3D artist. Even though<br>at the end of the day, it will never be perfect, and it doesn’t need to be. The other students that<br>have produced some really great stuff have actually complimented my work in Discord so at the<br>end of the day, maybe it’s just me being my own worst critic.<br>
					<br>
					I feel that what I did well in this experiment was quickly implementing the logic side<br>of the generator: creating autotilers, getting around HTML’s quirks, and making convincing overworlds<br>and dungeons. I thought that the logic, while flawed in very specific seeds, ended up being the<br>peak of the experiment. I only wish I could’ve come up with something more creative rather than<br>clouds and fog for the living part. What I originally wanted to do for the overworld was a heat<br>haze effect but that would’ve required shader knowledge that I do not have.
